# Sample Authorization server for FCM OAuth in Sinch in-app calling

This is an implementation of an Authorization server, that can be used to quickly get started with FCM push notifications when using Sinch's in-app calling Android SDK.

## Overview

This authorization server is implemented as a Node application, and makes use of the Google credentials included in a `service-account.json` file to mint short-lived OAuth tokens valid for FCM usage. You can find details on how this authorization server interacts with Sinch platform in the [Guide for migration to FCM v1](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/in-app-calling/android/migration-to-fcm-v1/) on Sinch website.

> ⚠️ **NOTE**:
>
> This authorization server uses a private key for Google API included in a `service-account.json` file; this is just a way to get you started quickly, but storing private keys in plain text is a poor security practice, and you should instead store them securely if you're planning to use this application in production.

 This application exposes 3 HTTP endpoints:

* `POST /oauth/token`: the "authorization server" described in [Guide for migration to FCM v1](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/in-app-calling/android/migration-to-fcm-v1/);
* `POST /oauth/fcm-token`: the "resource server" or "FCM tokens endpoint" described in [Guide for migration to FCM v1](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/in-app-calling/android/migration-to-fcm-v1/);
* `GET /ping`: returns 200OK unconditionally, can be used to verify that the service is up and running.

To start using this sample application and allow Sinch placing calls to Android devices, you essentially have to follow 5 simple steps:

1. provide your OAuth configuration and Google credentials by replacing placeholder values;
2. execute the authorization server locally on your machine;
3. make your application public on the internet;
4. update your FCM configuration to [Sinch Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/voice/apps);
5. test!

## 1) Placeholders replacement

To be able to start using  this implementation of an Autorization server, you have to first replace some placeholders with appropriate values.

You can find those placeholders in `./placeholders/*.json` files:

```text
./placeholders
├── config.json
└── service-account.json
```

Each of those files includes a detailed explanation on how to fetch the appropriate values for each placeholder; as a summary, the values to be replaced are:

* in `config.json`:
  * `client_credentials`: `client_id` and `client_secret` that Sinch will use to authenticate against your Authorization server
    * if you haven't provided any OAuth configuration to Sinch via [Sinch Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/voice/apps), `client_id` and `client_secret` can be any arbitrary strings;
    * if you have already provided an OAuth configuration to Sinch via [Sinch Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/voice/apps), `client_id` and `client_secret` in `placeholders/config.json` have to match "Client ID" and "Client Secret" in the Dashboard
  * `fcm_config`: the "Project Number" of the FCM project used in your Android app (available in the "FCM Console" of your FCM project)
* `service-account.json`: a `service-account.json` downloaded from the FCM console of the FCM project used in your app.

> ⚠️ **NOTE**:
>
> You won't be able to successfully start the authorization server until all placeholders have been replaced.

## 2) Execute the authorization server on your machine

The authorization server is a Node application, and can be executed directly via `npm`, or as a Docker container (the methods are equivalent).

To execute the authorization server via `npm`:

* install `node` and `npm` on your system, if you haven't already (see [installation guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))
* `npm install`
* `npm run start`

To execute the authorization server as a Docker container:

* install `docker` if you haven't already (see [download page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
* `docker compose up --build`

To verify the application is running as expected, you can run `./test-endpoints.sh` when the application is running, and check the console logs.

## 3) Make your application public on the internet

The authorization server will listen on port `1000`; to make the authorization server reachable from Sinch platform, you can easily expose your local port `1000` to the public internet using the free version of [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). You can install and setup your `ngrok` installation by following [this short Quickstart guide](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/).

Once you've installed `ngrok` and setup your account, you can run:

```plain
 ngrok http http://localhost:1000
```

Your console should now look something like:

```plain
ngrok                                                (Ctrl+C to quit)

Session Status                online
Account                       inconshreveable (Plan: Free)
Version                       3.0.0
Region                        United States (us)
Latency                       78ms
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://84c5df474.ngrok-free.dev -> http://localhost:8080

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

As long as both `ngrok` and the authorization server are running, your authorization server will be available publicly on the internet at the `*.ngrok-free.dev` address shown in the console. You can verify that by visiting `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/ping` in your browser.

> ⚠️ **NOTE**:
>
> The `*.ngrok-free.dev` URL will change everytime `ngrok` is restarted, which might be inconvenient; you can setup your [ngrok free static domain](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/free-static-domains-ngrok-users) to always obtain the same URL.

If you're using static domains, the command to make your application public is:

```plain
ngrok http http://localhost:1000 --domain=<your-static-domain>.ngrok-free.app
```

## 4) Update your FCM configuration to Sinch Dashboard

Now you have all information you need to setup your OAuth configuration in [Sinch Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/voice/apps); select your Sinch app and then the In-app Voice and Video SDK, and fill in the FCM OAuth configuration with the following values:

| Sinch Dashboard field           | Value |
| ---                             | ---- |
| **Client Id**                   | `client_id` from `./placeholers/client-credentials.json` |
| **Client Secret**               | `client_secret` from `./placeholers/client-credentials.json` |
| **Scope**                       | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase.messaging` |
| **Your Auth server URL**        | `https://\<ngrok-id>.ngrok-free.app/oauth/token` |
| **Your FCM token endpoint URL** | `https://\<ngrok-id>.ngrok-free.app/oauth/fcm-token` |

## 5) Final test

To verify that everything is setup correctly, you can try to install Sinch's sample app for Android SDK and place a call toward a user registered with the sample app. More specifically:

1. Download Sinch SDK for Android from the [download page](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/in-app-calling/sdk-downloads/)
1. install `sinch-rtc-sample-push` app on 2 Android devices (or simulators), using Android Studio
1. register `userA` on one device, and `userB` on the other one
1. place a call from `userA` to `userB`: Sinch platform will contact your authorization server to get the credentials needed to authorize the push request to FCM; you'll be able to see requests/responses being handled by your authorization servers in the logs of the authorization server
1. if a push notification reaches `userB`, the test succeeded.

> ⚠️ **NOTE**:
>
> Not every call to an Android device will trigger a request to your authorization server, because Sinch will cache the FCM tokens obtained by your server according to the `expire_at` field returned in the response (default value is 1 hour, see [Guide for migration to FCM v1](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/in-app-calling/android/migration-to-fcm-v1/#implementing-the-fcm-token-endpoint) for more details)
>
> This will greatly improve the performance of the Sinch platform, but might slow you down in development/integration phase as Sinch will contact your authorization server only after the existing token has expired.
>
> To simplify your development/integration, you can manually override the expiry of the FCM token by setting the variable `FCM_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS_OVERRIDE` in `./src/app.js` to a short TTL (e.g., 30 seconds).
